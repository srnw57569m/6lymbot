 Shout!
========

**Loud Python messaging.**

Shout is a single module providing simple messaging vocabulary for small applications. Shout is NOT a distributed messaging framework.

::

    from shout import Message, hears, shout

    class WhoAreYou(Message):
        pass

    @hears(WhoAreYou)
    def lucky_day():
        return "We are..."

    @hears(WhoAreYou)
    def dusty_bottoms():
        return "The threeee..."

    @hears(WhoAreYou)
    def ned_nederlander():
        return "Amigos!!"

    msg = shout(WhoAreYou)
    print("".join(msg.results))

    # We are...The threeee...Amigos!!


Why Shout
=========

* Decoupling of a GUI and it's behavior

  * PySide/PyQt signals are bound to widgets making it harder to decouple widgets. You have to explicitly connect each widget's signals with their slots which could live deep in a hierarchy of widgets.

  * Shout Messages are classes themselves, readily available to all other objects in their scope. Shout from inside, outside, top, or bottom of a widget hierarchy, Messages will still get to where they need to go!

* Shout is a single module, easily included with any package.

* It's easy and fun to use.


Get Shout
=========

Shout is available through the python package index as **pyshout**.

::

    pip install pyshout

* Note that only the python package name is pyshout, the module it installs is simply **shout**.
